Fake News detection using BERT-based Deep Learning Model
GitHub Link: https://github.com/Shruti-art/Fake-News-detection-using-BERT-Model.git
Developed a Fake News Detection model using a BERT-based deep learning model to classify news headlines as real or fake.
Utilized pretrained BERT model for contextual text understanding and improved classification accuracy.
Implemented the complete pipeline in Python using PyTorch,  Scikit-learn , Pandas and NLP preprocessing techniques.
Trained and evaluated the model on the Fake and Real News Dataset(Kaggle) and ISOT datasets containing labeled as fake and real.
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis and model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix and classification reports.
Developed an interactive  Streamlit web application for real-time fake news prediction.
